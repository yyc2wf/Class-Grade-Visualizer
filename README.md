# Class Grade Visualizer

## Why Build This?
The **Class Grade Visualizer** is a project all about learning how to build great user interfaces and connect them to meaningful data processing. The idea is simple: teachers upload a CSV file with grades, check some boxes to choose what analysis they want (like average grades or top performers), and see the results as clear visualizations. The data can also be exported as a fresh, processed CSV.

## What’s the Point?
The goal is to dive into front-end design, handle real-time data processing, and create something that’s both useful and easy to interact with. It's a hands-on way to get comfortable with full-stack development while building something practical.
